      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 3rd April, 2025, I ran continuously for an hour and seventeen minutes for my first 10k. Man was I happy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started last year; I was not physically active at all. The only sport I played was table tennis and that too, irregularly. I am from Karachi, Pakistan, and like most Karachites, weâ€™re not one for healthy eating. Add smoking as the cherry on top. Yearly visit to the doctor informed me of  my high cholesterol levels. Careless eating and excessive smoking were doing their part. I needed to do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
