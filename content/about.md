I'm Minhaj, a developer, proud dad, and master diaper-changer. I kicked off my career in 2016 and have been lucky enough to work with some amazing people from all over the world.

I've had some incredible experiences along the way, like speaking at [GDG 2018](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-gdg-devfest-karachi-2019/) and [Google IO 2019](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-google-io-2019-extended-karachi/) in Karachi. I talked about Go and got to hang out with students and professionals  in the field.

These days, Iâ€™m living in Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and working as a software engineer at [OneFootball](https://company.onefootball.com/). 

I enjoy books, whether they're fiction or tech-related. I enjoy sharing [my thoughts and what I learn through writing](https://medium.com/@minhajukhan), while balancing dad life with fun game nights in my spare time.
