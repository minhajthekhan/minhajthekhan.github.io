I'm Minhaj, a developer, and a proud dad. I started my career in 2016 and have been lucky enough to work with some amazing people from all over the world.

I've had some amazing experiences along the way, like speaking at [GDG 2018](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-gdg-devfest-karachi-2019/) and [Google IO 2019](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-google-io-2019-extended-karachi/) in Karachi where I talked about Go and Software Design.

These days, Iâ€™m living in Berlin and working as a software engineer at [OneFootball](https://company.onefootball.com/). 

I love reading, both fiction and tech-related books. I enjoy [sharing my thoughts and learnings through writing](https://medium.com/@minhajukhan), while also juggling the joys of fatherhood.
