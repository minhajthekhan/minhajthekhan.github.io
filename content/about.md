![about me](/about.jpg)

I'm Minhaj, developer, dad, diaper-changer.

I started my career in 2015 in a small startup while I was still completing my bachelors degree -- and _really_ started my professional journey in 2016 in Karachi.

Throughout thes years, I've made life long friends at work and learnt loads. What I'm most proud of during these for years  was to developing the confidence to speak to bigger audience about my learnings and things I felt passionate about. I was honoured to talk at [GDG 2018](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-gdg-devfest-karachi-2019/) and [Google IO in 2019](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-kolachi-presents-google-io-2019-extended-karachi/) in Karachi about Go.

Now, I live in Berlin, a software engineer at [OneFootball](https://company.onefootball.com/) writing Go for a living.
