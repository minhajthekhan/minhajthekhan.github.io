Pakistan, Karachi, [⁄Ø⁄æÿ±](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-urdu/home).

Once I moved out, I realized the value of all the small things back home.

To be able to have [a nice breakfast across the street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratha#/media/File:Parathas_being_made.jpg), or to be able to call a friend [at night to sip some chai](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/973833119481354184/), to be able to [get a nice massage at the hair salon](https://pakistaniat.com/2008/06/03/naai/) ‚Äî to be able to buy just a single cigarette if you want, without having to buy a whole pack, [to be able to visit a doctor at 10 in the night when you feel sick](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shamsi+Hospital/@24.8795673,67.1711667,3a,75y/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipMkYsmw8I7fHyEsAsBORA5J4XF3j4-cb5XT4nqm!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMkYsmw8I7fHyEsAsBORA5J4XF3j4-cb5XT4nqm%3Dw203-h270-k-no!7i2448!8i3264!4m7!3m6!1s0x3eb339f3de078409:0x3aedc7f2a79d07aa!8m2!3d24.8795673!4d67.1711667!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1v2dz_12?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Most importantly, you don‚Äôt need the internet, a charged phone, and a halal app before you [buy something to eat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AVQHnX-vmOQ) after the doctor‚Äôs visit.

To be around family. To see your kids being loved unconditionally, immensely ‚Äî to the point where you hardly see them, because they‚Äôre busy living too. It‚Äôs not just Mom and Dad in the clean fancy house; there are other kids to play with, bug, and fight within the slightly messy house. Mom and Dad aren‚Äôt worried whether their kids have eaten or if their needs are met. This is a safe house. The safe house is a bit dirty but never deserted. Expect the lights and fans to go off in this house due to power shortages, but never silent, always noisy. The food never runs out here. No day is mundane, every day‚Äî there is news.


<br/>

You're taking the bus back to your apartment; the bus is noisy from the chatter. A drunk man in the back blabbering ‚Äî gibberish, teens talking ‚Äî gibberish, a kid crying and asking for something from his mom, probably an iPad ‚Äî gibberish. Every voice is alien to you on this bus. Such is the life of an immigrant far from home.

Once I moved out, I realized the value of all the small things back home; most of all, to be able to talk -- often -- in your mother tongue, but more importantly, to be able to speak your heart.
