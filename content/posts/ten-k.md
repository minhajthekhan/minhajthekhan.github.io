On 3rd April, 2025, I ran continuously for an hour and seventeen minutes for my first 10k. Man was I happy!

It all started last year; I was not physically active at all. The only sport I played was table tennis and that too, irregularly. I am from Karachi, Pakistan, and like most Karachites, we’re not one for healthy eating. Add smoking as the cherry on top. Yearly visit to the doctor informed me of  my high cholesterol levels. Careless eating and excessive smoking were doing their part. I needed to do better.

Around the same time, one of my colleagues was preparing for a marathon. He talked of his trainings schedules and the many kilometres he had to run. I was always impressed to learn how many kms one can run, given I had ran zero, ever.

That nudged me over. I wondered if I also should run to get in a better shape. It takes nothing to start, just some nice shoes and — yeah thats pretty much it.

and there started my running journey. 

As I started running, I ran as fast as I could, only to realise that it’s not the best approach. I would get exhausted rather quickly, heart rate off the charts, yet still managing to make it 2 3 kms every run.

I like to think that I start new things off super motivated and go all out. I argue that it is the very nature of us humans; new things attract us, they occupy our minds for a certain amount of time; then they turn pale and yellow — or maybe it’s just me.

I learnt that I was supposed to run very slow, and run consistently. I think to run slowly, deliberately, when you can technically run faster — instills in you a kind of calmness. It delays gratification of you achieving the nice running numbers. It humbles you good. It prepares you to keep on running long instead of short and quick.

After 6 months of running slower — one fine day, I was able to run for a whole hour without pausing. This distance may be little to many who run, or to my future self when I look back at this life event *(hopefully),* but at this moment, I am very proud of this seemingly insignificant achievement.
