Your company manages an inventory of lego blocks. 

One fine day, the company gets a requirement to deliver the legos to Switzerland that are

- either red or white
- are of sizes 6x10 or 5x5
- if they are 5x5, they must be taller than 2cm
- if they are 6x10, they must be shorter than 3cm
- not more than 8k in total

You, as a software engineer in the company is tasked write an API that takes in requirements like these, and return lego shelf location so the warehouse can pack and ship.

You write a simple query

```sql
SELECT shelf_location
FROM legos
WHERE (color = 'red' OR color = 'white')
  AND ((size = '6x10' AND height < 2) OR (size = '5x5' AND height > 3)) LIMIT 8000;
```

and then you put that in code.

```go
func (r *repository) GetLegoShelfPositions(ctx context.Context, d1, d2 LegoDimension, colors []string, limit int) ([]string, error) {
	args := []any{colors, d1.Size, d1.Height, d2.Height, d2.Size, limit}
	rows, err := r.db.Query(`
		SELECT shelf_position
		FROM legos
		WHERE color = ANY($1) 
		AND ((size = $2 AND height < $3) OR (size = $4 AND height > $5)) LIMIT $6
	`, args...)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	defer rows.Close()
	return r.scanRowsAndGetPositions(rows)
}
```

## Moment of Reflection

At this point now, you‚Äôve taken a [‚Äúbusiness‚Äù](https://thecodest.co/dictionary/business-logic-layer/) requirement, and wired them into the [‚Äúrepository‚Äù](https://medium.com/@pererikbergman/repository-design-pattern-e28c0f3e4a30) layer. 

**When faced with situations where you want to query ‚Äúbusiness objects‚Äù that match a certain ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù - use the Specifications pattern.**

The specification pattern is asking whether a business object satisfies a set of requirements.

For example, in our case of Legos that need to be shipped to Switzerland:

```go
swissSpecification.IsSatisfiedBy(lego)
```

The implementation is also super simple.

```go
func (s *LegoSpecification) IsSatisfiedBy(lego entities.Lego) bool {
	if !slices.Contains(s.colors, lego.Color) {
		return false
	}

	for _, dimension := range s.dimensions {
		if lego.Dimensions.Equals(dimension) {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

At this point, you can also fetch all the legos and filter them through
the specification

OR better yet, move the query, closer to the business specification

```go
func (s *LegoSpecification) AsSQL() (query string, args []any) {
	args = []any{}
	query = "SELECT shelf_position FROM legos"

	query, args = s.buildColorQuery(query, args)
	query, args = s.buildDimensionsQuery(query, args)
	query, args = s.buildNotMoreThanQuery(query, args)
	return query, args
}
```

And finally, you can now simple plug this specification in your ‚Äúrepository‚Äù layer.

```go
func (r *repository) GetLogoBySpecification(ctx context.Context, spec Specification[Lego]) ([]string, error) {
	query, args := spec.AsSQL()
	rows, err := r.db.Query(query, args...)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	defer rows.Close()
	return r.scanRowsAndGetPositions(rows)
}
```

Voila! All the business removed from the repository layer.
